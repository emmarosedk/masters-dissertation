## Abstract
This dissertation contributes to the advancement of predictive modelling in the domain of rail 
transportation by providing a tailored solution for predicting travel durations on regular services. The proposed
model offers a practical tool for improving service reliability and enhancing the overall passenger 
experience in rail travel. The study begins by collecting extensive datasets from a platform managed by the
Federal Office of Transport (FOT) in Switzerland, a comprehensive repository of transportation data,
encompassing various parameters affecting rail travel duration. Subsequently, regression models including
tree-based methods are employed to develop predictive models. The results demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model in accurately predicting travel durations for passenger
trains. Moreover, insights gained from the analysis shed light on the critical factors influencing travel 
duration variability, thereby offering valuable implications for operational planning and resource allocation
within rail transportation systems.
